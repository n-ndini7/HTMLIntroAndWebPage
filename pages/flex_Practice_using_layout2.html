            <h2>First Article : The IPL 2020 Team of the Tournament</h2>
            <p>Let's start with the easy picks first. We're talking of Orange Cap winner and Kings XI Punjab (KXIP) captain KL Rahul along with Purple Cap winner and Delhi Capitals' (DC's) ace of pace Kagiso Rabada. That's 678 runs at an average of 55.83 and 30 wickets at 18.26, respectively.
                And opening with Rahul is Shikhar Dhawan - the first batsman to score back-to-back IPL centuries. The DC opener finished the tournament's second-highest scorer, 52 runs behind Rahul.</p>

            <h2>Third Article : Climate change: Hurricanes get stronger on land as world warms</h2>
            <p>North Atlantic hurricanes are retaining far more of their strength when they hit land because of global warming, say scientists.

                Previously, experts believed these storms died down quickly once they made landfall.
                
                But over the past 50 years, the time it takes for hurricanes to dissipate on the coast has almost doubled.
                
                Researchers says that climate change gives the storms more energy, which continues to power them over land.
                
                The scientists involved say that this will likely make hurricanes more damaging further inland in years to come.</p>
